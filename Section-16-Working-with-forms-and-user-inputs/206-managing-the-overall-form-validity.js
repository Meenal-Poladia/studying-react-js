    Managing The Overall Form Validity

    A state can be created which depends on whether all the fields are valid or not in a form. The state changes
    if either of the input is valid or invalid.
    This state can be later attached to the button attribute of disabled wherein it is disabled when the form
    is invalid. Similarly, styling can be attached when the when the button is disabled on hover, active.
