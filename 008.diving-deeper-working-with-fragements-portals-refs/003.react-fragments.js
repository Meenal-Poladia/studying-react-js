/*

    React fragment

    <React.Fragment> or <> </> is an alternative to Wrapper component which we created in order to avoid div soups.
    To use <React.Fragment> we need to import Fragment from react library.

    These two syntax's here render empty wrappers, which don't render any actual HTML element to the DOM. These two
    build in syntax's behind the scene work like the wrapper component we just created.
