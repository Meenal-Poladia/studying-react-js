    Creating a new Next js Project

    We need to have node js installed on our pc to install the nextjs library.
    Go to the terminal and use the command npx create-next-app. We will be prompt to confirm and give a project name.

    There are 3 important directories which the new next.js project consist of:
        1. pages
        2. styles
        3. public - this folder consist of all the images which we will use as resources in our project.

    In next js project we do not have a index.html because nextjs has its build in pre-rendering. This single page
    application is dynamically pre-rendered when a request reaches the data server so that we can return an initial
    page with content.

    The pages folder will be the most important folder because that is where we will set up the file based routing
    for our application.
