    Introduction To Next JS

    NextJS, is a framework for React. A framework building upon react. It is a framework which helps to build
    production level applications because it offers a lot of features that make building large scale production and
    React apps easier.

    React is labeled as a JavaScript library for building user interfaces which means that it's a third party package
    which we can add to our front end projects. So it's all about client side Javascript.
    It makes building complex user interfaces way easier than it would be with just JavaScript.
    React is called as a library because in its core, it's really only focusing on user interface using components,
    state, props.

    The difference between a framework and a library is that a framework is bigger.
    It has more features than a library. It's focusing on more things instead of just a single thing
    and it's also giving us clear rules, a clear guidance on how we should write our code, how we should structure our
    files and so on.

    In framework we don't have to add as many third party libraries to solve common problems, which we need
    in bigger apps.

    NextJS is called a framework as
        1. It has a lot of features
        2. Clear rules.
        3. It is a framework for React because it builds up on React. It enhances React, it uses React.
           We still write React code. We still build React components, but it's a framework for production
        4. It adds all those missing features which we typically need to add to React apps to really prepare them for
           production and to solve common problems.
