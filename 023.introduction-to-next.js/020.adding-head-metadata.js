    Adding Head Metadata

    Before we deploy any application on the server it is important to check its metadata.
    It is important to add a title and description to our page as it is good for our website SEO. It increases site
    visibility and crawlers use them for showing similar search results. example - 1

    Title and description can be changed for each single page as well

    example - 1
    function setTitleAndDescription(){
        return(
            <>
                <Head>
                    <title>
                        My first Page
                    </title>
                    <meta name="description"
                          content="This is the longest description I have come across">
                </Head>
            </>
        )
    }
