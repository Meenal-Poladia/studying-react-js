/*

    Simplified Routing with file based routing

    In react, we change the content viewed according to the url and thus we do not refresh the page and so
    it is a one page application. We do not make various request calls for each url.

    In Next.js we define routes using files and folders. We have a special folder for NextJS apps which has
    to be named as pages and then we are structuring that folder, defining the routes and paths your page supports.
