/*

    Adding First Page

    We can delete the api folder in the pages directory and home.modules.css in the styles folder.

    In the pages folder we have the index.js file which holds code which we want to render when the app loads.
    There is no html file, index.js file does the work of html.
    Pages with /domain name read the page which is made in the pages folder.
    The name of the file in the pages folder is the domain name which opens when the request is hit.

    example - our.domain.com/news[file name inside pages]

    React component which needs to be loaded goes into the file.

    To run the code we need to use the command npm run dev.

    When we right click on the page and choose view source page then we can see the actual source code of the page.
    This code is sent back by the server. As this page is sent from the server, we do not have any initial flickering
    of the page. This content can be viewed by our users as well as the search engines.
