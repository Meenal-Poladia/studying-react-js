/*

    What and why

    Class-Based Components exist and they are an alternative to functions.
    Classes are not a React feature, classes exist in modern JavaScript. We can define a class with a render method and
    the word render is a reserved keyword.

    Prior to 16.8 version we had to use only class based components as state couldn't be changed using functional
    components and we couldn't also manage side-effects in functional components. In the version 16.8 react introduced
    the concept of hooks. These are functions that bring features to functional components.
    Class based components cannot use react hook.
