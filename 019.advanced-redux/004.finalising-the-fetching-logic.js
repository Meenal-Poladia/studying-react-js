    Exploring the Redux devtool

    Redux devtools are extra tools which make debugging Redux and our Redux state a bit easier, because in more complex
    applications with a lot of Redux state, handling a lot of different slices and different actions can be
    difficult.

    We can simply search for Redux Devtools and we'll find a GitHub repository about the Redux Devtools. It can be
    installed as a browser extension. The extension cannot be operated from incognito window.

    The init in the console represents the initial state of the app. Whenever any action is dispatched it looks in
    the console window. We can also see the difference in the current state and the state once the action is dispatched.
    This is very useful when trying to understand the impact of actions.

    There is also a feature of time travelling in which we can click on the action dispatched and revisit the state
    to debug various states.
