/*

    Required Tools and Setup

    We need a tool for running our tests and asserting the results. We usually use the tool Jest

    We also need a tool for stimulating our react app or components. We use the react testing library for stimulating
    the react app.

    Jest and react testing library are installed in our app when we use the command create-react-app. We can view
    the testing library in the package.json file under the dependencies.
