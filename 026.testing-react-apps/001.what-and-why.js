    What and Why?

    We as developers usually do manual testing in which we write the code, preview it and then test it in the browser.
    Testing is important as we understand where we are creating bugs or what will the users see.

    Testing the app manually always is also error prone as it is hard to test all possible combinations and scenarios
    all the time.
    With automated testing, we write extra code that runs and tests our other code and our main application code.
    We test the individual building block of our app with the changes in the entire app. It is very technical and it
    allows us to test all the building blocks at once. If automated testing is combined with manual testing then
    we can catch errors easily and get more error free code.
