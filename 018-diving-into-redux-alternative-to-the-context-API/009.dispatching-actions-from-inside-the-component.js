    Dispatching Actions From Inside The Component

    useDispatch returns a function which we store in a variable. We use the dispatch function to send data to the store.

    Dispatching an action is an object which takes the type property which is one of the identifier of the reducer
    specified in the reducer function.

    example -
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
