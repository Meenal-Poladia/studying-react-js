    Redux versus React Context

    Disadvantages of React Context:
        1. React Context may have a very complex setup and managing state with react context can become quite
           complex.
        2. When building a large application with a lot of components and a lot of things going on,
           using React Context can end up with spaghetti code and deeply nested JSX code.
        3. Performance - If the data changes a lot then context is not a good option, it can only be helpful for
           low frequency tasks like changing theme, user authentication.
