    Creating A Redux Store

    To create a store to store the state, we have to first install redux in our project using npm.
    Later import createStore function from redux. This function accepts a reducer as an argument. We have to export
    the index.js of store as it is only then that the data will be available to other components in the project.

    example
    store -> index.js

    const store = redux.createStore(reducerFunction);

    export default store;
