/*

    Installing React Router

    To add routing to our application we will use the package npm install react-router-dom.

    This package allows us to listen to different url changes and load different content.

    The first step is to define the routes we want to support, so we must define which URLs, which paths we want to
    support, and which components should be loaded for different paths.
    The second step is to activate our router and load the route definitions that we defined in the first step.
