/*

    Navigating Programmatically

    Except for using the Navlink or Link to programmatically navigate users to another page. There is a hook called
    as the useNavigate which navigates user to another page.

    example
    const navigate = useNavigate();

    function navigateHandler = () => {
        navigate("/products");
    }

    return <>
        <button>
            Click me to Navigate
        </button>
    </>
