    Adding basic validation

    It is a good practise to not just validate inputs on the client side but also on the server as the users can
    manipulate with the code from the client side through console window.
    Client side validation is just good for providing users with feedback and not for security mechanism.

    One important validation check is not allowing the user to submit, empty input or having many empty spaces in
    the input. This can be done by using the javascript function trim().

    It is a good user experience to notify the user that the form is not being submitted as the input is invalid.
