    React to lost focus

    When the user clicks inside the input but does not type anything and later clicks outside we need to tell user
    that user had to do something but the user did not. This is the blur state for which we have onBlur attribute
    where we can pass a function. This event is fired when the input loses focus.

    In the blurHandler we can set the setTouched state to true and also start validation here.
