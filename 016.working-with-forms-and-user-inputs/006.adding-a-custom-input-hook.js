/*

    Adding a custom input hook

    When we have many inputs in the form and similar logic is being repeated for each input then we can create a custom
    hook in which we add the logic for managing the states and logic.

    We can pass function as well to our custom hook parameter. If we want to call a certain function in the custom hook
    from the other component then we can return it from the custom hook so that it can be used in the component.
    These returned function value can be called inside the handlers.
