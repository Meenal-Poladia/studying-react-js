    Managing the overall state validity

    The overall validity of the form depends on whether all its inputs are valid or invalid.

    For setting the validity of the entire form we can use an useEffect wherein we check if each input is valid based
    on state value and in the dependency array add the state of the input so that the useEffect is rendered whenever
    the state changes or any of the input changes.

    It is also important to enable or disable the button on the state of the overall form. It is a good practise to
    disable it when the form is invalid.
