    Css Transition Animation

    Transition property is a css property which allows us to specify some css properties which should not be applied
    instantly but instead be animated over time.

    Transition property cannot be applied on elements which are block or none as css doesnt find a need to style
    elements which are hidden. -> example 1

    example 1
    transition: all 300ms ease-out
