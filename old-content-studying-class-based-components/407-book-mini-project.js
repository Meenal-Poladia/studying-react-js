    React was developed by facebook in the year 2011 and is currently the most popular
    Javascript library used to build user interfaces.

    Some Competitors of react are Angular, Svelte and Vue.

    When it comes to react, it's all about components and you can think of components as
    independent chunks of user interfaces. Components can be as small as one element.
    Component = User Interface

    The benefit of the component is that you can build a bunch of independent, isolated and most
    importantly, reusable user interfaces that you can then piece it together just like Lego blocks and
    as a result build even super complex apps without going insane.

    While their app can have as many components as you would like, it will always, always have at least
    one called root component.

    The benefits of react:
    1. You can build independent pieces of user interfaces, meaning changing logic or layout
       in one command will not break your whole up.
    2. Once the component is ready to go. You can reuse it all throughout Europe, but component
       code is still stored in one place. So if you ever need to make some changes, you don't have
       to run around like a headless chicken, simply locate the component, apply the changes and
       all the instances will be automatically updated.
    3. Behind the scenes react is using something called virtual dom, where only the component that
       needs to be updated is effective. So, the speed is also fast which is done without rendering
       the whole which in turn, of course, increases the speed of your final product and as a result,
       the user experience as well.
    4. I can reuse the component all throughout my application so if you want to make some changes
       then the changes need to be made only in one place and then all the instances will be
       automatically updated.
