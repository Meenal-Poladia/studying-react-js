/*
Functional versus Class based components

    Using class based components or functional components is a matter of ones preference.

    Some people prefer using functional components but when using life cycle hooks they
    switch to class based components but others prefer class based components over functional
    components.

    There are no performance benefits specified as of present for using one component
    designing style over another.

    If you are going to be working with functional component and you do need state as well
    as you need life-cycle method, then you are going to have to reach for class based
    component or react hooks.
