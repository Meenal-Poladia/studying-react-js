/*

    Adding Conditional Return Statements

    If we want to add a style dynamically in react then we use the style attribute. The style attribute in react
    takes an object. We use {{}} to apply styles in react. The first curly bracket is for outputting content dynamically
    and the inner one is for sending an object to the style attribute.

    If the css attribute has 2 or more words then we should either use camel case or - between both the words.

    For example -
    const braHeight = 3 + actualHeight;

    <div style={{height: barHeight, "backgroundColor": "red", "background-color": "red"}}>
