    Working with breakpoints

    Breakpoints can be used for finding out an error in our code snippet. For accessing the breakpoints we need to
    access the sources tab of the developers console.
    React development process, gives the browser a bridge, between the code that runs in the browser and the code we
    wrote,and we can access this code in the sources tab, by going to that User's folder. If the files are not in the
    users folder then we should also check the webpack folder.

    To set the breakpoint we need to go to the file for which we want to see the error. By clicking on the line number
    we set the breakpoint on the file. once we add the a break point and then execute the action that triggers that
    part of the code where the break point is placed code execution stops.
    The line is then highlighted in blue in the debugger once executed.

    To step into the next function we click on the step into next function icon. This can be done to see the values
    set by the previous function. We can also hover over the values to see the values.

    To go to next function we can click o step over next function icon.

    Once debugging is done we can click on the play icon which represents resuming script execution.
