    Using React devtools

    React devtools is a dedicated tool which is available for React Development that helps us with React specific
    problems ans also in understanding our React Application better.

    React devtools are available for download on google for browsers like firefox however if we want to use it on
    chrome then there is an extension for using react devtools. We can simply visit the extension store and download
    the extension on our browser.
    After adding the extension we will have 2 new tabs on our inspect window: Components and Profiler.

    If we click on Components then we can see a component tree which we are building using react whereas the
    Elements tabs on the inspect window shows the DOM which we can use for debugging the HTML code. As we hover
    over the elements in the Components tab the UI side of it starts getting highlighted. To get more information
    about the component we can click on them. We can get information about the props on them, the handlers attached to
    them, the component rendering it and the hooks attached on the component. Changing anything on the dev tools is
    also reflected on the UI.

    We can also search for a particular element or change the settings of the tabs using the settings corg.
