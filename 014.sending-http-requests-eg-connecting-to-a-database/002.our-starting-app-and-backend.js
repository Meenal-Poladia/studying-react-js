    API stands for Application Programming Interface.

    HTTP requests means that the code we're dealing with has a clearly defined interface, on how we can achieve certain
    results and do certain tasks, and when we talk about APIs in the context of HTTP requests.

    There are 2 different standards for how a server should expose its data:
        1. REST
        2. GraphQL

    Different URLs to which you send different requests will give you different chunks of data. That's what makes it an
    API.
