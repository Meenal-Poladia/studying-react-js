    What is API

    API stands for Application Programming Interface. API have clearly defines rules and interface in order to
    receive a particular result. API's in the context of HTTP requests are typically about REST or GraphQL API's.
    which deals with standards on how a server should expose data.
    Different API's give different chunks of data and different endpoints give different results.
