/*

    Building the code for Production

    When we use the command npm run build, under the hood this will produce a code bundle with highly optimized and
    transformed code which is ready to be uploaded. Once the build process is completed it creates a build folder which
    contains the code that needs to be deployed on the server.
    In the static folder we have our optimised javascript. Its not a readable code but it is valid and executable.

    It is the content of the build folder which needs to be uploaded.
