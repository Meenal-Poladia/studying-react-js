    Deployment Steps

    After writing the code and testing it thoroughly it is important to optimise the code.

    Once the code is optimised it is important to build the app for production. Writing a script will help to output
    a production ready bundle or our code which is unified and automatically optimised to be as small as possible.
    We can take this output and move to the server. Shipping less code helps to load the website faster.

    Once the code is build we take that bundle and upload it on the server of our choice. The last step is to configure
    the server or our hosting provider offering.
