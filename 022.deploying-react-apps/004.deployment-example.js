    Deployment Example

    React SPA is a static website which contains only HTML, CSS and Javascript files with a couple of images. It does
    not contain any code that must be executed on the browser. All the code will be parsed by the browser and will be
    executed on the computers of our visitors.
    Therefore, we only need a Static Site Host. We don't need any hosting provider that executes code on the server.

    To deploy app on the firebase we need a google account. Once we login we need to create a new project. If we
    want to add google analytics then we accept the test. Once the setup is completed. On the side bar we click
    on the build option and later choose Hosting.

    Firebase will walk us through how to deploy apps. We need to install firebase CLI on our project to use its command.
    Follow the steps which are shown on the modal. After initialing firebase settings on our local computer we deploy
    the app.

    To take the website offline once it is on the cloud then we use the command -> firebase hosting:disable
