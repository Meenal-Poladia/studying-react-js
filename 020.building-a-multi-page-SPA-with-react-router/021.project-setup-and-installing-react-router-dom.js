    Project setup and installing react router dom

    The routing functionality of watching the URL and loading different content is not build-in react. To support these
    URL changes and different use cases we install a package called react-router-dom.

    The first step is, we must define the routes we want to support, so we must define which URLs, which paths we
    want to support and which components should be loaded for different paths.

    The second step is to activate our router and load the route definitions that we defined in the first step.

    The third step, is to make sure that we have all these components that we want to load and that they may
    also provide some means of navigating between those pages so that our users can move smoothly between the
    different pages.
