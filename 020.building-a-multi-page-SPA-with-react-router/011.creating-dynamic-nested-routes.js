/*

    Creating Dynamic Nested Routes

    It is possible to create a dynamic nested route inside an existing route and it is also important that the path
    needs to be registered where the component is.

    For eg:
    <Route to:`quotes/${params.id}/comments`></Route>

    OR

    <Route to:`quotes/:quotesId/comments`></Route>
