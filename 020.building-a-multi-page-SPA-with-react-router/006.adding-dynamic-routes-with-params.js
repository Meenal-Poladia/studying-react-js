/*

    Adding Dynamic Routes With Params

    When we have many items and we wish to show detailed data about each item when clicked on it, we use
    dynamic routes. In this we navigate to a new screen showing details about the product clicked.

    To generate dynamic path we use the syntax -> "/product/:id".
    This means that react knows that our domain will be products but everything defined after : can take any value,
    number and is completely dynamic.
