    Creating a new react project

    The easiest way of getting started with a React project is to use a tool called Create React App.

    This is a tool which you can use to create React projects. Which are basically pre-configured folders
    with some basic React code files and most importantly a bunch of configuration files which help you build
    that React App for production use because it turns out that there will be a couple of transformation and
    optimization steps between developing any React App and running a React App in production.

    This project which is created with Create React App, will give you a nice development environment
    with a development web server which allows you to preview the application locally on your machine.
    It will allow you to preview this application in a way where the browser will automatically update
    the page whenever you make changes in your code.

    It simply simplifies our development process. It adds a couple of key transformation steps which we need
    and it will later also help us optimize our React code before we push it to a production server.
    We need node.js as react is a javascript library and the runtime for JavaScript is node so it allows us to run
    JavaScript code outside of the browser.

    The package.json file in the end holds all the dependencies of this project, for example, React, but also a couple
    of development dependencies, which are involved with these transformation and optimization steps.
    The SRC folder holds the actual source code you will be working on.
