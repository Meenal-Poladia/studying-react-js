/*

    Outputting dynamic data and working with expressions in jsx

    Hard coded values can be replaced by dynamic values using {} inside which javascript code can be outputted.

    Single curly braces opening and closing. And the special thing about these curly braces
    inside of your JSX code snippets is that in these curly braces between them, you can run basic JavaScript expressions.

    JavaScript will extract the value stored in this constant and basically inject it here into this HTML code.


example - {1 + 1}
{Math.Random()}
