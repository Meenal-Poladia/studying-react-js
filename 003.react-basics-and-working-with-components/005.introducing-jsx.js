    Introducing JSX

    JSX is HTML code inside of javascript. It stands for javascript XML.
    This only works because there are transformation steps running behind the scenes.

    The NPM start command transforms the react code into JavaScript code which is browser friendly code.
    We can see the transformed code using developers console by going to the source session. Towards the left
    we can see the files systems as in our project. The javascript files contains the code in a cryptic manner as that
    is the code transformed for the browser to understand.
