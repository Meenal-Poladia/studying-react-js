    Organising component files

    As the project gets bigger and bigger there is a need to organise the file in folders and sub-folders.
    The various folder which we can create in our project are:
        1. UI components which are not tied up to any feature in particular.
        2. Some files we are dealing with expenses and its various features which can be created in the Expenses folder
           Thus, creating a context based folder. Expenses folder will be sibling of UI folder.
        3. Creating a logical nesting of components which are component specific. It helps to understand the parent
           child relationship better.

    This helps to keep our components and the project organised.
