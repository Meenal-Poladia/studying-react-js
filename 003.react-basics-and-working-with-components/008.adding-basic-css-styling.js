    Adding basic css styling

    Including css file in the javascript code makes the build process aware the file needs to be included.

    Either a global style sheet needs to be considered or we can have one stylesheet per component which needs to be
    imported into the component.

    Here we do not add the keyword class but add className to add the css style class. And this can be strange, but you
    have to keep in mind that this here is not really HTML. It looks like HTML, but it's this special
    JSX syntax invented by the React team.
    The class attribute was renamed to className because class is a reserved word in JavaScript.
