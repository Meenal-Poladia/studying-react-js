    How react works

    With React we define the desired target state and React is then responsible for generating and running the actual
    DOM instructions which update what's visible on the screen.

    Javascript follows an imperative approach where we need to first create an element, later append or prepend it and
    then sets its inner text to something so that it is visible on the DOM. However, in react we just add a code
    looking like HTMl inside which we add the desired tag and the content which we want to render on the screen.

    Thus, javascript follows an imperative approach because you are giving clear instructions, clear step-by-step
    instructions, what JavaScript and the browser should be doing. However, this can become cumbersome if we are
    creating large scale applications.
