/*

    The concept of conception (children-props)

    The approach of building a user interface from smaller building blocks is called composition.

    Inside the child component we have the props which we get from the parent component. The word children is reserved
    for the props passed down from the parent component so the word children is a reserved word.

    One attribute which every component receives even though a prop is not passed is called as props.
