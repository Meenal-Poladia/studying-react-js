    Understanding different types of automated testing

    The 3 main main categories of tests are: unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests.

    Unit Test means testing the individual building blocks like functions, components in isolation. Due to testing each
    unit our project may contain hundred and thousands of unit tests. We basically test each function and component
    that make up the entire application. If the individual piece works then the entire application will work.

    In Integration tests, we test the combination of multiple building blocks together. Projects may contain multiple
    integration tests but not as many as unit test.

    End to end tests test the complete scenario in the app as the user would experience them like login in the user and
    redirecting him to a certain page. These test aim to reproduce what a real human would do. It is like manual
    testing but in a automated way. These tests are fewer than unit and integration test.
